# Description

An implementation of uploading files on node using the new node 16v features, such as the pipeline function. The socket.io library is also used to monitor the upload progress of each file. This project doesn't even use a framework taking advantage only of libraries and native resources of node.

## Requirements

Node.js v16.0 and later.

```bash

  # clone the repository

```
